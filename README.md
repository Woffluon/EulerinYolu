A captivating puzzle game based on the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, where players must find an Eulerian path through various levels of increasing complexity.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧩 Multiple challenging levels based on graph theory
- 🎨 Beautiful SVG-based graphics
- 📱 Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- 🏆 Level progression system
- 🎮 Intuitive touch and mouse controls
- 📊 Progress saving with local storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eulerin-yolu.git
   cd eulerin-yolu
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready files.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Objective**: Traverse each bridge exactly once to solve the puzzle.
2. **Controls**:
   - Click/Tap on a node to start your path
   - Click/Tap on connected nodes to move
   - Complete the level by crossing each bridge exactly once
3. **Hints**:
   - Look for nodes with an odd number of connections
   - Remember, an Eulerian path starts and ends at different nodes if there are exactly two nodes of odd degree

## 🗺️ Level Guide

1. **First Bridge** - Introduction to the basic mechanics
2. **Circular Path** - A simple circular challenge
3. **Advanced Crossing** - More complex bridge arrangements
4. **Expert Challenge** - The ultimate test of your pathfinding skills
